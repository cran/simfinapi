\arguments{
\item{ticker}{\link{integer} Ticker of the companies of interest.}

\item{simfin_id}{\link{integer} 'SimFin' IDs of the companies of interest. Any
\code{simfin_id} will be internally translated to the respective \code{ticker}. This
reduces the number of queries in case you query the same company via
\code{ticker} \emph{and} \code{simfin_id}.}

\item{type}{\link{character} Type of shares outstanding to be retrieved.
\itemize{
\item \code{"common"}: Common shares outstanding.
\item \code{"wa-basic"}: Weighted average basic shares outstanding for a period.
\item \code{"wa-diluted"}: Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for a period.
}}

\item{period}{\link{character} Filter for periods. As a non-SimFin+ user, you have
to provide exactly one period. As SimFin+ user, this filter can be omitted
to retrieve all statements available for the company.
\itemize{
\item \code{"q1"}: First fiscal quarter.
\item \code{"q2"}: Second fiscal quarter.
\item \code{"q3"}: Third fiscal quarter.
\item \code{"q4"}: Fourth fiscal quarter.
\item \code{"fy"}: Full fiscal year.
\item \code{"h1"}: First 6 months of fiscal year.
\item \code{"h2"}: Last 6 months of fiscal year.
\item \code{"9m"}: First nine months of fiscal year.
\item \code{"6m"}: Any fiscal 6 month period (first + second half years; reserved
for SimFin+ users).
\item \code{"quarters"}: All quarters (q1 + q2 + q3 + q4; reserved for SimFin+
users).
}}

\item{fyear}{\link{integer} Filter for fiscal year. As a non-SimFin+ user, you
have to provide exactly one fiscal year. As SimFin+ user, this filter can
be omitted to retrieve all data available for the company.}

\item{start}{\link{Date} Filter for the report dates (reserved for SimFin+ users).
With this filter you can filter the statements by the date on which the
reported period ended ('Report Date'). By specifying a value here, only
statements will be retrieved with report dates ending AFTER the specified
date.}

\item{end}{\link{Date} Filter for the report dates (reserved for SimFin+ users).
With this filter you can filter the statements by the date on which the
reported period ended ('Report Date'). By specifying a value here, only
statements will be retrieved with report dates ending BEFORE the specified
date.}

\item{api_key}{\link{character} Your 'SimFin' API key. It's recommended to set
the API key globally using \link{sfa_set_api_key}.}

\item{cache_dir}{\link{character} Your cache directory. It's recommended to set
the cache directory globally using \link{sfa_set_cache_dir}.}

\item{sfplus}{\link{logical} Set\code{TRUE} if you have a SimFin+ account. It's
recommended to set \code{sfplus} globally using \link{sfa_set_sfplus}.}

\description{
Common shares outstanding (point-in-time) and weighted average
basic/diluted shares outstanding for all periods can be retrieved here.
These shares are the aggregate figures for the entire company. If you are

\section{Fiscal year}{

Only works with \code{type = "wa-basic"} and \code{type = "wa-diluted"}.
}

\section{Parallel processing}{

This function supports parallel processing via \code{future.apply}. If your
machine has several cores (most have), you can make the API calls in
parallel. To do so, define a \code{future::plan()} before calling the function.
